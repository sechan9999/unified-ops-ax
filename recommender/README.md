# Hybrid Recommender System

Combines **user behavior** (implicit feedback), **product data** (category/price features),
and **contextual signals** (device, time of day, weekend) into a tunable hybrid ranker,
with an offline evaluation harness and a FastAPI serving layer.

## Quickstart

```bash
# offline evaluation (trains all models, tunes hybrid, prints comparison table)
python -m recommender.run_eval

# unit tests
python -m pytest tests/test_recommender.py -q

# serving API
uvicorn recommender.service:app --port 8100
curl -X POST localhost:8100/recommend -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": 42, "device": "mobile", "hour_bucket": "evening", "k": 5}'
```

Dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `fastapi` (no sklearn required).

## Offline results (temporal holdout, K=10)

| model | recall@10 | ndcg@10 | coverage@10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| popularity | 0.103 | 0.058 | 0.30 |
| item_cf (BM25) | 0.194 | **0.120** | 0.92 |
| content | 0.149 | 0.078 | 0.72 |
| sim_blend (α=0.9) | **0.196** | 0.119 | **0.93** |
| hybrid_contextual | 0.195 | 0.117 | 0.77 |

Hybrid ≈ **2× NDCG vs popularity baseline** with 2.6× catalog coverage.
Tuned weights on this data: cf 0.2, content 0.6, popularity 0.2
(varies by seed/scale — the tuner adapts automatically).

### v2 improvements (2026-07)

- **BM25 reweighting** of the interaction matrix before item-item cosine:
  IDF-boosts rare items, length-normalizes heavy users. CF NDCG@10
  0.075 → **0.120** (+60%), recall 0.142 → **0.194** (+37%).
- **Rank-percentile fusion** replaces minmax score blending — CF/content
  scores are heavy-tailed, so minmax squashed most signal near 0 (the old
  tuner drove CF weight to 0 because of it).
- **~6× faster weight tuning**: component scores precomputed once per
  user; each grid point is a weighted sum, enabling a finer simplex grid.

### v3 experiment: similarity-level blending (2026-07)

`SimBlendRecommender` blends at the *similarity matrix* instead of the
score level: `sim = α·sim_cf + (1−α)·sim_content`, then `score = sim @
user_vec`. Content neighbors backfill items with thin interaction data
*before* scoring — a cold-item fix score-level fusion can't express.
Validation picked α=0.9; result: best recall@10 (0.196) and coverage
(0.93) of all models, NDCG on par with pure BM25 CF. Score-level hybrid
keeps the edge only when context/popularity signals matter.

## Evaluation protocol

- **Temporal split**: days 0–70 train / 70–80 validation (weight tuning) / 80–90 test — no leakage.
- Ground truth: click-or-stronger events on items *not* seen in train.
- Metrics: Recall@K, NDCG@K, catalog coverage@K.

## Key design decisions

- **Cold start**: users with no history get `0.6·popularity + 0.4·context affinity`.
- **Explainability**: `/recommend` returns per-item `reason` (cf/content/popularity/context
  contributions) — useful for debugging, trust, and merchandising review.
- **Context as lift, not count**: `P(cat|ctx) / P(cat)` so context only reorders where it
  genuinely deviates from global behavior.
- Demo fits on synthetic data at startup; the generator injects real structure
  (segment→category preference, context→category boosts) so models have learnable signal.

## Production path (engineering handoff)

1. **Batch training**: replace startup-fit with a daily job that trains and writes artifacts
   (similarity matrix, profiles, affinity table); service loads artifacts only.
2. **Feedback loop**: log impressions + clicks with request context → retraining data;
   watch for position bias (log rank, use inverse-propensity weighting later).
3. **Experimentation**: A/B or interleaving; guardrails = CTR, coverage, latency p99 < 50 ms.
4. **Scale**: swap dense matrices for sparse (`scipy.sparse`), ANN retrieval (FAISS) at
   >100K items; candidate-generation + ranking split.
5. **Model roadmap**: ALS/BPR embeddings → two-tower retrieval + GBDT ranker with context
   features → sequence models (SASRec) for session awareness.
