# Gap Analysis: datahub-drift-guard

- **Feature**: datahub-drift-guard (blast radius → validated fix)
- **Analyzed**: 2026-07-24
- **Baseline**: [plan](../01-plan/features/datahub-drift-guard.plan.md) — no design
  doc this cycle, so the plan's Scope (steps 1–9) and Success criteria are the
  contract measured against.
- **Implementation**: `sechan9999/splunk_hec_v3` @ `be6eba1`
  (`5f26e1a` Milestone B, `be6eba1` Milestone A)
- **Match Rate**: **94% → 99%** after Act iteration 1 (see §6)
- **Verdict**: above the 90% gate on the first pass; Act iteration 1 then closed
  Findings 1 and 2. Only the deliberate deviations (Devpost, deploy) remain.

## 1. Scope coverage

| # | Scope item | Status | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Synthetic change manifest (`ChangeEvent`, fixtures) | Complete — 6 scenarios | 100% |
| 2 | Blast radius via lineage (transitive, terminal leaves) | Complete, **exceeds** plan (bidirectional) | 100% |
| 3 | Report object + Streamlit rendering | Complete | 100% |
| 4 | Milestone-B tests | Complete — 13 checks | 100% |
| 5 | Fix generation | Partial — golden-case path only | 70% |
| 6 | Validate before surfacing | Complete — hermetic, semantic | 100% |
| 7 | Groundedness guard | Complete | 100% |
| 8 | CI drift job | Complete — **green on GitHub** | 100% |
| 9 | Docs + submission | Partial — README done, Devpost deliberate skip | 80% |

Mean 94%. B (1–4) and A's core loop (6–8) are all complete; the gap is
concentrated in step 5 and the Devpost half of step 9.

## 2. Success criteria

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| `blast_radius` deterministic and correct on every fixture | **Met** — 6/6, plus a determinism test |
| ≥1 `deprecate` scenario produces a fix that passes `pytest` end to end, in CI | **Met** — drift job green on master (run 30090930677) runs propose→validate |
| Negative control → empty blast radius (no false alarm) | **Met** — `cosmetic` control |
| Existing 74 checks still green, layer env-gated | **Met** — 96 total, originals intact |
| Measured, own numbers recorded | **Met** — 6/6 blast, 3/3 fixes validate, 1 corrupted rejected, 0 false alarms |

All five success criteria met.

## 3. Findings

### Finding 1 — Fix generation covers only the golden-case path (Scope 5)

The plan named three fix flavors: (a) a golden case for a change that trips a
rule, (b) surfacing the successor when a downstream now points at a deprecated
upstream, (c) a `policies/` edit when a rule references a dataset/tag that no
longer exists. Only **(a)** shipped, for the three codifiable kinds
(deprecate, retag_sensitive, break_quality).

This is the right 80/20 — (a) is the drift→PR loop and the KASSI-shaped
differentiator, and it is fully validated. But the report should not imply the
other two exist. (b) already exists as `remediation.suggest_successor` and is
merely un-wired into `propose_fix`; (c) is unbuilt. Neither is load-bearing for
the demo.

**Fix if pursued**: wire `suggest_successor` into `propose_fix` for the
deprecate-with-successor case (small); defer (c).

### Finding 2 — The validate button spawns a pytest subprocess; unverified on Streamlit Cloud

`validate_fix` runs `python -m pytest` in a subprocess. That is verified locally
and in CI, but the **UI "Validate" button** would spawn that subprocess *inside
the Streamlit Cloud container*, which may be sandboxed, slow, or unable to spawn
child processes. AppTest runs locally so it did not exercise the deployed path.

This matters because the button is where a judge would see validation happen
live. Untested on the actual runtime.

**Fix if pursued**: after deploying v3, click the button on the live app; if the
subprocess is blocked, fall back to the in-process equivalent (build the
`DatasetContext` from the generated case and call `decide` directly — same
semantic check, no child process). The CI/test path stays as the authoritative
proof regardless.

### Finding 3 — Devpost not updated (deliberate deviation from Scope 9)

The plan said "Devpost What's-next updated". It was **not**, on purpose: the live
Devpost is the v2 submission, and v3 is a separate private repo. Describing a
feature that does not exist in the submitted repo on the submission page would
be exactly the claim-ahead-of-product problem this project keeps catching. The
README (in v3) is updated; the measured numbers are recorded there. If v3
becomes a submission, the Devpost update belongs to that moment.

### Finding 4 — v3 is not deployed (out of scope, noted for the demo)

The drift guard is only visible via local `streamlit run` today. Not a plan
gap (deployment was never in scope), but the demo story is incomplete until v3
is connected to Streamlit Cloud. Ties to Finding 2 — deploying is also what
would let the validate button be verified.

---

## 4. Work that exceeded the plan

- **Bidirectional lineage** (Scope 2): the demo graph's `downstream`/`upstream`
  lists disagree, so a naive downstream walk misses the
  `llm_costs → user_features_v1 → router_model` chain. Computing consumers as
  `declared downstream ∪ reverse-upstream` is both more correct and what
  surfaces the multi-hop reach to an ML model — the headline scenario.
- **Corruption test** (`test_a_wrong_fix_is_rejected`): not named in the plan,
  but it is what makes "validated" mean anything — a gate that never fails is
  decoration. This is the single most important test in the milestone.
- **Hermetic validation** via a `GOLDEN_DIR` override: the fix is validated
  against a scratch copy, never mutating the real suite.

---

## 5. Recommendation

At 94% the cycle clears the gate; the two real gaps (Findings 1–2) are small and
neither blocks the demo. Suggested order if iterating: Finding 2 first (it is the
one a judge would hit — verify or add the in-process fallback), then Finding 1(b)
(wire the successor fix, cheap). Finding 3 is correct as-is; Finding 4 is a
deploy step, not code.

Ready for `/pdca report datahub-drift-guard`, or one short Act iteration to close
Findings 1–2 first.

---

## 6. Act iteration 1 — re-check

- **Date**: 2026-07-24
- **Commit**: `b667ab3` (v3)
- **Match Rate**: 94% → **99%**
- **Suite**: 96 → **99 checks**; CI green on master (run 30091664639)

| # | Scope item | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Fix generation | 70% | **95%** |
| 9 | Docs + submission | 80% | 80% (Devpost deviation stands) |

### What closed

**Finding 1 — successor now wired into the deprecate fix.** `propose_fix` surfaces
where consumers should migrate for a deprecation, from the deprecation note
(`user_events_v1 → user_events_v2`, high confidence) or inferred from lineage
(`session_metrics_v1 → session_metrics_v2`, medium), and offers nothing when
neither can justify one (`legacy_metrics`). Root cause found while wiring it:
`_context_for` was dropping `downstream`/`upstream`/`deprecation_note`, so the
lineage successor path saw an empty graph — fixed. Surfacing is independent of
whether a *new* rule fired, so an already-deprecated dataset still gets a
migration target. Three tests pin the note, lineage, and none paths.

**Finding 2 — in-process validation fallback.** `validate_fix` now falls back to
`validate_fix_inprocess` when a subprocess cannot be spawned (or on
`allow_subprocess=False`), so the UI validate button never silently no-ops on a
sandboxed host. The fallback runs the same `decide` the golden suite would and
**still rejects a corrupted fix** — proven by a test that forces the fallback
and feeds it a wrong verdict. The subprocess path (with the coverage gate)
remains the authoritative check where a subprocess is available.

The (c) flavor from Finding 1 (a `policies/` edit when a rule references a
now-missing dataset/tag) is still deferred — it has no demo scenario and is not
load-bearing; Scope 5 is scored 95%, not 100%, to reflect that.

### Remaining (not blocking, deliberate)

- **Devpost** (Finding 3): unchanged — v3 is a separate private repo, not the
  live v2 submission.
- **Deploy** (Finding 4): v3 still local-only; deploying is what would let the
  validate button be exercised on the real runtime, but the in-process fallback
  now guarantees it works regardless.

**Gate**: 99% ≥ 90%. Ready for `/pdca report datahub-drift-guard`.

---

## 7. Act iteration 2 — a bug only the live deploy could show

- **Date**: 2026-07-24
- **Trigger**: v3 deployed to https://splunkhecv3.streamlit.app/ (Finding 4 closed)
- **Commit**: `0e4d472` (v3) · **Suite**: 99 → **100 checks**

### Finding 5 — the validate button false-rejected on Streamlit Cloud

Clicking "Validate" on the live app returned **Rejected** for a perfectly valid
fix (`visitors` deprecate → `deprecated_dataset` block). Root cause: the deployed
Streamlit runtime installs `requirements.txt`, which has **no pytest**, so the
subprocess exited non-zero — and the iteration-1 fallback only caught the case
where a subprocess *cannot be spawned*, not one that *runs and fails for an infra
reason*. So a missing test framework was reported as "your fix is wrong".

This is exactly the risk Finding 2 flagged as "unverified on Streamlit Cloud",
and it was invisible to AppTest (which runs locally, with pytest present). Only
clicking the button on the real deploy surfaced it — the case for deploying
before claiming the feature works.

**Fix**: the subprocess path now distinguishes an infra failure (framework
missing, or output with no pytest result line) from a real test failure and
falls back to the in-process check instead of rejecting. The UI calls the
in-process path directly, since the Cloud runtime will never have pytest; the
subprocess + coverage-gate path remains the CI check. A test
(`test_subprocess_infra_failure_falls_back_not_rejects`) mocks the missing-pytest
exit and pins both halves: a valid fix falls back green, a corrupted one is still
rejected.

**Verified on the live app**: after redeploy, the same click now returns
*"Validated — in-process: got block/['deprecated_dataset'], expected
block/['deprecated_dataset']. Safe to open as a PR."*

Findings 2 and 4 are now both fully closed — the validate button works on the
real runtime, proven by driving the deployed app, not just asserted.
